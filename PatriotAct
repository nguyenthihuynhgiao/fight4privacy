<li>USA Patriot Act 2001</li> 
            <ul>The USA PATRIOT Act, which stands for "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act," is a piece of legislation that was enacted in the United States in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. It was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001.

                The USA PATRIOT Act aimed to enhance law enforcement and intelligence agencies' capabilities to combat terrorism and protect national security. It introduced a wide range of provisions that expanded the government's surveillance and investigative powers, particularly in the following areas:
                
                Surveillance: The act allowed for increased surveillance of communication methods, including wiretaps, electronic communications, and the collection of business records.
                
                Searches: It expanded the authority of law enforcement to conduct searches, including "sneak-and-peek" searches, which allowed agents to search premises without immediately notifying the target.
                
                Information Sharing: The act promoted increased information sharing and cooperation among intelligence agencies and law enforcement.
                
                Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court: It expanded the authority of the FISA Court, a secret court that reviews and approves requests for surveillance and intelligence gathering related to national security.
                
                Money Laundering and Financial Investigations: The USA PATRIOT Act imposed stricter regulations and requirements on financial institutions to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
                
                Detention and Deportation: It allowed for the detention and deportation of non-U.S. citizens suspected of involvement in terrorist activities.
                
                The USA PATRIOT Act was a controversial piece of legislation. Supporters argued that it was necessary for national security and the prevention of terrorist attacks, while critics expressed concerns about potential violations of civil liberties and privacy rights. Some provisions of the act have been challenged and amended over the years, and there have been ongoing debates about the balance between security and individual freedoms.
